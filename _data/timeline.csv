Future,"I will be the instructor for CIS 194, a half-credit Haskell course, for the Fall 2018 semester. The emphasis of the course will be on real-world use cases for Haskell. My responsibilities include developing the curriculum, establishing course policies, leading a 1.5 hour weekly lecture, managing two teaching assistants, and various grading duties."
Present,"I am a software engineer intern at Facebook this summer. I work on infrastructure for Facebook Live."
Spring 2018,"I was a TA for CIS 120 Programming Languages and Techniques I for three semesters, from Spring 2017 until Spring 2018. My responsibilities included leading a weekly recitation, holding weekly office hours, and grading homework and exams."
Fall 2017,"I was enrolled in two computer science courses. CIS 552 Advanced Programming, which is taught in Haskell, takes good programmers and turns them into excellent ones. CIS 240 Introduction to Computer Architecture teaches you how a computer works starting from transistors and bits and working up the abstraction chain to assembly and eventually C."
Summer 2017,"I successfully completed a Google Summer of Code project for the Elm Software Foundation. My project laid the foundations for using Elm to make native iOS apps. I learned a great deal during this project and really enjoyed it. You can <a href='https://github.com/pzp1997/elm-ios'>look at the the code</a> for the project on GitHub or <a href='https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4964906492231680'>read more about it</a> on the GSoC website. (For the uninitiated, Elm is a functional programming language for creating web apps. It has no runtime exceptions, a superb refactoring and debugging experience, and an excellent community. It is a really fun and useful language and I strongly encourage you to check it out.)"
