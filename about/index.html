  <h3><em>Welcome!</em></h3>
  <p>
    Hey there! Welcome to my site! My name is Palmer, and I am currently
    studying computer science as an undergradutate student in the
    School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Pennsylvania
    in Philadelphia, PA. I am very proficient in many programming languages,
    and I guess you could say that I have a knack for programming.
    At the moment, I am just trying to broaden my horizons as much as possible
    by working on various projects, which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/pzp1997">GitHub</a>.
    Since coming to Penn, I have also become quite interested in the
    theoretical side of computer science, and lately, have been writing
    mathematical proofs both for courses and for fun.
  </p>

  <h3><em>Beginnings</em></h3>
  <p>
    My programming career started in 2012 when my school's Engineering Club was building a rudimentary 3D printer, and we needed someone to design some software for it. Despite being a high school freshman and having little to no prior programming experience,
    I decided to take on the challenge. To suit up for the task, I started learning Python. After completing that project I knew I had caught the coding bug, and went on to teach myself JavaScript, Processing, Java (including the whole AP Computer Science
    curriculum), and a slew of other programming languages.
  </p>

  <h3><em>Future</em></h3>
  <p>
    I am excited to announce that I will be working for the
    Elm Software Foundation this summer as part of Google Summer of Code!
    Elm is a functional programming language for creating web apps.
    My project is to explore the possibility of extending Elm for mobile app
    development. You can read more about it on the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4964906492231680">GSoC website</a>!
  </p>

  <h3><em>Present</em></h3>
  <p>
    Starting in Spring 2017, I became a TA for one of Penn's intro computer science courses, Programming Languages and Techniques I (CIS 120). My responsibilities include leading a weekly recitation, holding weekly office hours, and grading homeworks and exams.
  </p>
  <p>
    The computer science courses that I am currently enrolled in are Programming Languages and Techniques II (CIS 121), which focuses on data structures and algorithms, and Automata, Computability, and Complexity (CIS 262).
  </p>
  <p>
    In the past semester (Fall 2016), I was enrolled in two computer science courses: Programming Languages and Techniques I (CIS 120) and Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (CIS 160). CIS 120, which is taught in OCaml and Java, taught me about
    abstraction and modularity, test-driven development, and how to implement basic data structures. In CIS 160, I learned graph theory, set theory, and combinatorics, as well as how to write rigorous mathematical proofs.

    In my spare time, I am learning C from <em>The C Programming Language</em> by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

  <h3><em>Past</em></h3>
  <p>
    Last summer, I interned at
    <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/?home">Sefaria</a> as a software engineer. The most prominent contribution I made was the export to drive feature for source sheets. You can
    <a href="https://blog.sefaria.org/2016/08/10/new-feature-robust-editing-and-printing-for-source-sheets/">read about it here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Last year, I wrote a handful of ScratchX extensions, including a
    <a href="https://github.com/pzp1997/geolocation-scratchx">geolocation extension</a>!
  </p>
  <p>
    In the summer of 2015, I experimented with computer vision using the OpenCV library. My primary project was finding an effective method of determining the gender of a person in real-time using full body images (i.e. no face detection). This project is
    still a work in progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my junior year of high school, I created a
    <a href="https://github.com/AJHS/CMS">Content Management System (CMS)</a> with a friend of mine in Computer Programming Club. I wrote the entire backend using Node.js (Express and MongoDB), as well as a good portion of the frontend using Jade (a nifty
    little HTML templating language), CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery.
