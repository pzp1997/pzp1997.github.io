I am a software engineer at Meta. I develop tools for managing feature flags and feature rollouts that are used by most engineers across the company. I get great satisfaction from improving the developer experience and productivity of my fellow engineers. I am particularly passionate about improving system reliability by making it harder for people to make mistakes.

I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Pennsylvania with a master's degree and a bachelor's degree in computer science. In school, my main academic interests were functional programming and programming language design and implementation. One of the highlights of my university experience was getting the opportunity to teach. I was the instructor of [CIS 194](https://github.com/cis194/lectures), an intro to Haskell course, in the fall of 2018. Additionally, I was a teaching assistant for CIS 120, one of the introductory programming courses, for three semesters.

Throughout high school and college I worked on many side projects which can be found on my [GitHub]({{ site.data.links.github }}). The most prominent of these projects is [elm-ios](https://github.com/pzp1997/elm-ios), an experimental framework for creating iOS apps with native UIKit components using the [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) programming language, which I created during [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/5097842980945920).
