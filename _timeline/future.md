I will be the instructor for CIS 194, a half-credit Haskell course, for the Fall 2018 semester. The emphasis of the course will be on real-world use cases for Haskell. My responsibilities include developing the curriculum, establishing course policies, leading a 1.5 hour weekly lecture, managing two teaching assistants, and various grading duties.
