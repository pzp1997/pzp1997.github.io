I was the instructor for CIS 194, a half-credit Haskell course, for the Fall 2018 semester. The course emphasized practical applications of Haskell. Some assignments that the students worked on were parsing and interpreting the untyped lambda calculus and making the backend for a link shortener. My responsibilities included developing the curriculum from scratch, leading a 1.5 hour weekly lecture, creating homework assignments, establishing course policies, managing two teaching assistants, and various grading duties.
