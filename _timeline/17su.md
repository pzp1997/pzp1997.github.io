I successfully completed a Google Summer of Code project for the Elm Software Foundation. My project laid the foundations for using Elm to make native iOS apps. I learned a great deal during this project and really enjoyed it. You can [look at the the code](https://github.com/pzp1997/elm-ios) for the project on GitHub or [read more about it](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4964906492231680) on the GSoC website. (For the uninitiated, Elm is a functional programming language for creating web apps. It has no runtime exceptions, a superb refactoring and debugging experience, and an excellent community. It is a really fun and useful language and I strongly encourage you to check it out.)
